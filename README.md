SQUAROIDS
=========

Squaeroids are simplified representation of most relevant data that everybody can understand.

Squareoids isolate data and concentrate attention to most familiar one, which help us to perceive invisible in a way we actually can experience. 
Like other objects that surrounds us at highway. They differ in size, speed, weight and we might collide with them. 

Squareoids have multiple animate options to graphically show dynamics of influences and properties. 
For example, change of colour in effected amount, 25% in quarter of it’s height. 
This can be further extended to multiple vertical bars for richer experience of multiple properties.

Squareoids allow dynamic representation if object interaction.

Squareoids can further evolve to more complex data listings, as well as include external data like photos, movies, Wikipedia etc…

Squareoids are gate to a richness of the asteroid big data. 


### User Stories

- A user can see a report of the Earth, like mass, size, speed, orbit, type (planet), etc.
- A user can flip this report over for more information and resources
- A user can select an asteroid 
- A user can see the selected asteroid's relative distance to hitting the Earth
- A user can select an impact option for a selected asteroid and see the selected asteroid hit Earth
- A user can see a damage report of a selected asteroid if it hits the earth
- A user sees the Earth as a Square Representation that is not to scale
- A user sees asteroids as a Square Representation relative to other asteroids
